# Title: SUPER SHY by newjeans  
![supershy album](./tools/supershy.jpg)  
I'm super shy, super shy  
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine  
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time  
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy  
I'm super shy, super shy  
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine  
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time  
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy  
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy  
And I wanna go out with you, where you wanna go? (Huh?)  
Find a lil' spot, just sit and talk  
Looking pretty, follow me, 우리 둘이 나란히  
보이지? 내 눈이 갑자기 빛나지 when you say I'm your dream  
You don't even know my name, do you?  
You don't even know my name, do you?  
누구보다도 I'm super shy, super shy  
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine  
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time  
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy
