I'm super shy, super shy  
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine  
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time  
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy  
나 원래 말도 잘하고 그런데 왜 이런지? I don't like that  
Something odd about you, yeah, you're special and you know it You're the top, babe  
I'm super shy, super shy  
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine  
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time  
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy  
I'm super shy, super shy  
But wait a minute while I make you mine, make you mine  
떨리는 지금도 you're on my mind all the time  
I wanna tell you but I'm super shy, super shy  
You don't even know my name, do you?  
You don't even know my name, do you?  
누구보다도  
You don't even know my name (super shy, super shy)  
Do you? (Make you mine, make you mine)  
You don't even know my name (you're on my mind all the time, I wanna tell you)  
Do you? (But I'm super shy, I'm super shy)
